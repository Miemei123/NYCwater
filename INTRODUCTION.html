			 <p>Concerns about bottled water use and resulting problem of plastic waste disposal problem has increased in major cities across the United States, including New York City.  This is due in part to the steady increase in bottled water use in these cities, fueled by dominant positive perceptions of bottled water taste and quality.  What is not clear is whether this trend is helped by residents’ complaints about tap water color and odor, or household/sociocultural influences or negative news coverage of the Flint Michigan water crisis, etc.  This study was part of a collaborative project to examine the factors influencing NYC residents’ choice of drinking water from tap/fountains compared to bottled water sources.  </p>
			 <p>The specific objective of this poster is to assess the relationship between sociocultural influences of NYC residents (especially minors) and their attitudes towards drinking water fountains vs prevalence of bottled water use in NYC.  Key information used in this study was based on an online survey of perceptions and prevalence of bottled water use and safety in NYC area.  Statistical analyses and spatial visualizations were done to provide insights into how sociocultural influences of NYC residents impact the growth in bottled water use in the City.  The results suggest that parental influence, household cultural norms, and household drinking water choices were very important in how respondents made drinking water choices later in life. </p>
