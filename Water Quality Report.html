         <p> Dear Friends:</p>
       <p> On behalf of my nearly 6,000 colleagues at the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), I am proud to report that New York City continues to enjoy some of the best tap water in the world. In 2018, we continued to deliver more than 1 billion gallons of clean and delicious drinking water to nearly 10 million people every day.</p>
       <p>Many communities throughout the United States remain concerned about the safety of their public water supplies. Here in New York, we are fortunate to have a water supply that is well protected and operated by dedicated scientists, engineers and other professionals who have earned admiration among their colleagues throughout the world. </p>
       <p>The evidence of New York City’s high-quality drinking water is in the numbers and on your taste buds. </p>
       <p> In this report, you will see that New York City’s drinking water continued to meet or sur- pass every national and state standard for quality. These data are based on 53,200 sam- ples that were collected by DEP scientists throughout our reservoir system, and at nearly 1,000 street-side sampling stations in every neighborhood across the City. Those samples were analyzed 654,000 times by scientists working in our four water quality laboratories. Robotic monitoring stations on our reservoirs provided another 1.3 million tests to ensure DEP was sending the best-quality water to New York City at all times.</p>
       <p>The excellent scientific results were validated last summer by our customers and other New Yorkers. In 2018, New York City earned first place in the New York State Tap Water Taste Test competition. That honor was based on hundreds of people who lined up in New York City and at the state fair in Syracuse to taste water from dozens of cities, towns, and villages. In the end, New York City earned the blue ribbon for our great-tasting water </p>
       <p> None of these good results happen by accident. Our drinking water system relies on
vast reservoirs, large dams, hundreds of miles of aqueducts, and thousands of miles of water mains. Steady and focused investment in drinking water infrastructure is key to the future of New York City. That is why you will also find in this report news about a number of infrastructure investments DEP is making now and in the decades ahead. In 2018, we announced a $1.2 billion tunneling project in Westchester County to improve opera- tional resiliency and flexibility between a key reservoir and treatment facility. The largest repair project in the history of our water supply system, the $1 billion Delaware Aqueduct Bypass Tunnel, continued to make steady progress last year as a tunneling machine exca- vated toward the Hudson River. You will find details about these and other projects in the pages that follow.</p>
      <p> As we look forward to 2019 and beyond, I want to thank you for entrusting DEP with the operation, protection, and maintenance of your drinking water supply. We take great pride in delivering the best water to millions of New Yorkers every day.</p>
